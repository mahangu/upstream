This Alpha Release release is named after the Elizabethan dramatist Christopher Marlowe (1564 - 1593). With this  release we are overreaching, and attempting to go places in a very short period of time. Although we don't plan dying early like Marlowe, he embodies exactly what this release is - a daring thrust at greatness.

"Come, let us march against the powers of heaven,
 And set black streamers in the firmament,
 To signify the slaughter of the gods. "
Tamburlaine the Great, Part 2 - Act V, Scene III
