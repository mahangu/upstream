Steps to create a localised po file.

* Make sure your working directory is ./trunk/po/


Note: These steps are optional. The upstream.pot only needs to be generated once (or whenever strings are changed in the source )

* Generate upstream.pot.

	pygettext -o upstream.pot  ../canoe/canoe ../kayak/kayak ../upstream-base/upstream && xgettext --no-wrap -j -o upstream.pot ../canoe/canoe.glade

* Run this command to append to bottom of the file some strings we may need in the future:

cat << END >> upstream.pot

msgid "Back"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cancel"
msgstr ""
END


These steps are required:

* Generate a .po for the _new_ language (in this case portuguese).

	LANG=pt_PT.utf8 msginit --no-wrap

* Or, if a .po for the language already exists, merge the pt.po with the upstream.pot.

	msgmerge --no-wrap -U pt.po upstream.pot

* Make your changes or additions using your favorite editor.

* Generate .mo files for actual use by gettext.

	mkdir -p pt/LC_MESSAGES/
	msgfmt pt.po -o pt/LC_MESSAGES/upstream.mo
