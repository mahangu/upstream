Upstream is a collection of tools that allow users to send in system specific log and troubleshooting data to support personnel. It can be easily modified to output data to any pastebin or support tracker.

This Alpha Release release is named after the English romantic poet William Wordsworth (April 7, 1770 â€“ April 23, 1850). In coding this version of Upstream we've been like Wordsworth, and have let ourselves be influenced heavily by what is around us. In particular, we've listened to our packagers and written Lodge, a new build system in the hope that it will make Upstream a little easier to bundle up and ship. We're proud of this version, and we hope it will serve you well.

"This City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air."

(Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802)
